<p><strong>Project 1:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ksb214/Udacity-machine-learning-nd-kbhambare/tree/master/boston_housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Predicting Boston Housing Price</a></strong></p>
<p>The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and a model to help the real estate agent in the area to compete with peers is required. Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. In this project task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for clients' homes.</p>

<p><strong>Project 2:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ksb214/Udacity-machine-learning-nd-kbhambare/tree/master/finding_donors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Find Donors for CharityML&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>CharityML is a fictitious charity organization and determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. Goal will be evaluating and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield by identifying individuals with income more than $50,000.</p>

<p><strong>Project 3:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ksb214/Udacity-machine-learning-nd-kbhambare/tree/master/customer_segments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creating Customer Segments</a></strong></p>
<p>In this project unsupervised learning techniques are applied data of product spending collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. First data is explored by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. In the next this data is preprocessed by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data performed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Project 4:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ksb214/Udacity-machine-learning-nd-kbhambare/tree/master/dog-breed-classifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Breed Classifier</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;In this project, a pipeline was built with CNN. Given an image of a dog, algorithm identifies an estimate of the canine&rsquo;s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this project, an agent was designed that can fly a quadcopter, and then trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project 6:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ksb214/Udacity-machine-learning-nd-kbhambare/tree/master/Capstone_project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Taxi Fare Prediction with Deep Learning</a></strong></p>
<p>Objective of this capstone project is to predict the New York Taxi fare accurately, given taxi pick up and drop off locations, on a given date with given number of passengers. Root mean square error is calculated and serve as a metric to check the accuracy of the model.</p>
